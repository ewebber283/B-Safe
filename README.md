# B.SAFE

## Purpose
Walking into 2020, we thought we’d be traveling the world. Instead, we traveled from the kitchen to the living room on repeat. But after months of staying home, travel is starting to rebound and we’re excited to get back out there.
However, it won’t look quite like it did before. From increased health and safety measures you are not quite familiar with, to your personal concerns about the COVID cases increase. Travel prep becomes such a hassle.
And that's where B.SAFE app steps in!
 
With B.SAFE you can view a plethora of information about each country and COVID’s impact. The app will additionally show the heat map of confirmed COVID-19 cases for each country - allowing for you to make the best decision possible when traveling out of the country again.
